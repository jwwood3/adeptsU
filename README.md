Rules:

Introduction -

Everything in the kingdom of Sereg is run by one resource: mana. It is used in farming, manufacturing,
governing, the military- every possible aspect of day to day life. Mana is obtained through the
processing of the abundant gemstones found within the mines of Sereg's borders.
You are one of the magi currently in charge of supervising the gem mines. The king has recently
decided that the management of the mines needs to be consolidated under one person, and has given all
of the magi a trial period in which to show that they are the best person for the job. The adept who
produces the most mana within the timeframe of the contest will be awarded leadership of the mines
and have access to wealth and power beyond their wildest dreams- will it be you?

Components -

Game board
Rules book
Score pad
120 spell cards representing 40 different spells
8 Adept cards
5 colors (red, blue, green, purple, yellow) of the following:
– Ten wooden cubes (representing miners)
– Nine wooden mana discs
5 processing queues
One first player pawn, white
Two white cubes (representing bonus miners)
One white disc for round tracking
Crystalline counters, representing the following gems:
- 25 each of topaz (orange), amethyst (purple), citrine (yellow), and onyx (black)
- 20 each of ruby (red), sapphire (blue), emerald (green), and diamond (clear)

Setup -

1. Each player should choose one of the five different sets of colored cubes and discs. Each player
also gets a processing queue; these are all identical and not color coded to a specific player. All
ten miners (cubes) should also be placed in front of each player.
2. For each player, one mana disc starts at zero on the processing track that runs along the outside
edge of the main board. The remaining eight discs should be stacked on top of the gem symbols
at the bottom of the mana battery on the left side of the main board.
3. Place a number of gems in or around their corresponding gem symbols on the board based on
the number of players in the game using the table below:

Players Major Gems (Ruby, Emerald, Sapphire, Diamond) Minor Gems (Topaz, Citrine, Amethyst, Onyx)
   2                         8                                         10
   3                        12                                         15
   4                        16                                         20
   5                        20                                         25

4. There are forty spells in this game, numbered one through twenty and given an A or a B suffix
to distinguish them. Spells “1A” and “1B” both have the same casting cost (in this case, one
topaz). Typically, spells with an “A” suffix benefit a player without directly affecting their
opponents. Spells with a “B” suffix are attack spells which will negatively affect opposing
players.
How many copies of each spell there are depends on the strength of the spell. Each spell has
between two to four copies. When selecting a spell for inclusion in a game, player should
include all copies of that spell card.

The game is designed for players to use either the A or B version of each spell. Based on the
type of game you prefer, some suggested spell selections are below:

First Game: A: 1. 2, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 16, 20
            B: 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19
Ivory Tower: All A cards
Battlefield: All B cards
2 players: A: 2, 3, 4, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 19, 20
           B: 1, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18
5 players: A; 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 15, 17, 18
           B: 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 19, 20

A full list of spells can be found later in this rules book.
Once you have built the spell deck, shuffle the spell cards and deal two face down to each
player. Place the remaining spell cards in a stack face down next to the board; this represents
the library pile.
5. The eight Adept cards should go into a stack next to the board. Place the white disc on the first
spot of the round track (below the mana battery), and place the white bonus miners next to the
board. Pick an impartial method to determine who goes first, and that player receives the white
first player pawn. Play will continue clockwise from that person.

Gameplay -

There are five phases within each game turn. Each phase (except phase IV) is divided into two steps:
spell casting, and phase actions. There are also adept bonuses that will activate at different points
during each phase; see phase IV actions for more details on adept bonuses. The general overview of the
phase actions is:

Phase I: Players assign miners to work sites
Phase II: Miners produce gems
Phase III: Players select spells
Phase IV: Adept bonuses are awarded
Phase V: Gems are processed
Note: During the first turn, players will not have resources to cast spells until after phase II. Thus, spell
casting is skipped during the first two phases of the first turn. Additionally, as adept cards are not
awarded until phase IV, there will be no adept bonuses during the first three phases of the first turn.

Step 1: Spell Casting

Each spell has a phase during which it may be cast, indicated in the center of the card. The cost of each
spell is indicated by the gem symbols on the top half of each card, and must be paid when the spell is
cast. The gems used to cast the spell may come from any spot in a player's processing queue and/or a
player can pay the spell cost by moving the corresponding mana battery disc(s) down one space per
gem used (as there is no mana in the battery initially, this is not an option immediately- see Phase V for
details). Any gems from the player's queue used to pay a spell cost are returned to their corresponding
mine.
Each player only has one opportunity to cast a spell per phase, and players may not cast multiple spells
during the same phase. Once a player either passes or casts a spell, the next player in turn order makes
that choice, until all players have either passed or cast a spell.
Spells that resolve immediately are placed directly into the discard pile. Spells that would have an
effect later in the phase remain in play until their effect is resolved. For instance, Barrier prevents other
players from assigning miners to work sites for a mine. Therefore, the Barrier spell card may be placed
over the mine in question for the remainder of the phase as a reminder. Another example is Siphon;
upon casting it may remain in front of the player who cast it until the end of the phase until the effects
fully resolve. No spell will ever remain active past the phase in which it was cast.

Step 2: Phase Actions

Phase I: Miner Assignment

On each player's turn, they may assign miners to a single work site (represented by the roman numerals
surrounding each gem on the board). A player may assign a minimum of two up to a maximum of four
miners to a work site, and this rule may only be altered if a spell specifically overrides it (such as
Ambition or Telepathy). Once the first player has chosen the first work site for their miners, the next
player assigns miners to a work site, and so forth. Once all players have assigned their first round of
miners, the process repeats via turn order until all miners are assigned.
Miner placement requires advanced planning- if a player were to place three miners apiece during their
first three assignments, they would be unable to place the one miner they have remaining, as doing so
would not meet the minimum required group size. Some players may run out of miners before others
(by choosing to place them in larger groups), if this occurs, simply skip them when assigning future
miners.
Each mine has three free work sites, which will later produce gems in work site order. Once there are
any miners assigned a work site, it is considered occupied and may not be shared with another player. If
a player has miners at a work site, they may not later add more miners to that same site, although they
may assign miners to a later work site for the same mine. In the event that all work sites on all mines
are claimed, a player may not assign any further miners.

Phase II: Gem Production

At each mine, the number of miners at each work site will produce a number of gems equal to how
many miners there are. Gems that are produced go into the first (leftmost) stage on the matching
processing queue spot on the corresponding player's queue. Each mine is handled separately and the
gems are produced in the order of work site placement. If the gems from a mine run out, miners at later
sites will not receive any gems from that mine.

Phase III: Spell Research

During this phase, each player will visit the library, represented by the deck of spells. Each player will
draw three spells, and decide on one to take into their hand. The maximum number of spell cards a
player can have in their hand at any time is five. Players may draw spells even if they are at five
already, but if they chose to keep a spell from their research they must discard one of their other spells
immediately. Players are never required to take a spell during this phase. If, at any point during the
game, the library does not contain sufficient spells to draw the required amount, the discard pile should
be shuffled and added to the bottom of the library.

Phase IV: Adept Determination

For each of the eight types of gems, the adept card for that gem will be awarded for the player who has
the highest number of those gems in their processing queue. For turn one, there will only be gems in
the first stage in the queue, but later on the gems from each stage on the queue must be added up to
determine the holder of that adept title.
If there is a numerical tie for any type of gem, the player with the most gems of the type in question in
the final stage of their queue will be awarded the adept title for that gem. Further ties will be decided
by the player with the most gems in the second stage. If the number of gems is identical in all three
stages of the queue, no player will receive the adept card. There is no restriction on the maximum
number of adept titles a single player can hold at once.
The player who wins the adept title for each gem takes the corresponding adept card and places it in
front of them to indicate they will have access to that adept’s bonus ability when applicable. Any
players who does not have at least one adept card at the end of this phase may immediately draw a spell
from the library and add it to their hand.

Phase I Adept Bonuses

Topaz- The topaz adept may place 2-4 miners inside a mine of their choice. This is represented by
placing their miners on the gem symbol for that mine instead of on a work site. These miners are
immune to all spells, and will produce first during phase II. This placement take places previous to any
normal work site placements.
Ruby- The ruby adept will receive the two white bonus miners for use during assignment and
production phases. They are returned to the supply at the end of Phase II.

Phase II Adept Bonuses

Citrine- At every work site where the citrine adept’s miners successfully produce gems, they produce
one additional gem.
Emerald- The emerald adept chooses one mine at which gem production is increased by two at every
work site.

Phase III Adept Bonuses

Amethyst- For every spell the amethyst adept does not select during the draw phase, they may move
their battery discs up equal to the cost of the spell they discarded. For example; “Tunneling” has a cost
of one ruby and one topaz. If that spell is not selected, the amethyst adept would move their ruby and
topaz mana battery discs up one spot each.
Sapphire- The sapphire adept may keep up to two spells (instead of just one) drawn during this phase.
However, they are not required to do so.

Phase V Adept Bonuses

Onyx- For every type of gem that is in stage 3 of your queue prior to processing, the onyx adept moves
their mana battery discs up on the corresponding tracks one space. The onyx adept always receives
exactly one bonus space on any relevant battery track, regardless of how many gems of that type are in
stage 3.
Diamond- The diamond adept may choose one type of gem that will be worth three mana when
processed this round. This bonus applies to all gems of the selected type which are processed,
regardless of which player is doing the processing. This ability does not affect the battery track in any
way.
Note that if there are no gems in stage 3 of a player’s queue (as is likely during the first two turns), the
phase V adept bonuses will not activate.

Phase V: Gem Processing

First, all gems move one stage down the processing queue from left to right. Those in stage 1 move to
stage 2, those in stage 2 move to stage 3, and those in stage 3 are processed. When a gem is processed,
it is converted into mana, which is recorded on the processing track along the outside of the main
board. Every major gem (ruby, emerald, sapphire, diamond) is worth two mana, and every minor gem
(topaz, citrine, amethyst, onyx) is worth one mana. Processed gems are returned to the mines from
which they came.
Additionally, for each individual gem that is processed, a player will move their mana battery discs up
one place along the matching track within the mana battery. For every gem processed, the
corresponding battery disc should move up exactly one spot (barring any spells that affect this, such as
Intensify). Thus, it would require a player to process a total of ten gems of a certain type to fill their
battery for that gem.
The numbers on the battery tracks indicate how many mana that track is worth at the end of the game.
There is no limit on how many spaces a battery disc may move during a single turn, however, if a disc
is at the maximum value on a battery track, additional processed gems of that type have no effect on
that track (although they still count for processing mana).
At the end of phase V, the first player marker passes clockwise, the disc on the turn track moves to the
next turn, and a new turn begins.

Game End:

The game ends after eight full turns. At the end of Phase V of the final turn, gems in stage 3 of a
player's queue are processed as normal. Any spell or adept bonus applies only to gems processed from
stage 3, and the battery discs only move for those gems processed from stage 3.
After all players have processed their gems, the game ends. At this point, any gems left in a player’s
queue are processed for half mana (rounding down). These gems will not award any battery
advancement. The onyx and diamond adept bonuses from turn 8 do not have any effect on these gems,
nor does any spell cast during turn 8 affect the value of these gems in any way. These gems only count
for (half) processing mana.
Once the remaining gems are processed, enter the player's processing track mana total into the
“Processed” row on the score pad. Next, the mana total from each battery track is entered into the score
pad. Players are awarded mana equal to the value of the spot in each battery that their disc occupies.
After all values have been entered into the score pad, the values are totaled and the player with the most
total mana wins. In case of a tie, the player who has the highest processed mana total wins. In case of a
further tie, players may rejoice in a shared victory.

Gameplay Tips
Typically, the diamond and onyx adept bonuses will not take effect until the third turn. The adept title
will still be awarded for the first two turns, but will have no effect on gameplay except in a select few
circumstances due to the effects of some spells (such as Advancement).
Gems that are produced during turns 7 and 8 will usually not be processed and will award no battery
mana (again, barring the effects of some spells). They can still be used to cast spells, though, and will
be worth half processing mana at the end of the game.
Remember, you can cast spells by sacrificing battery levels! This can often be advantageous if your
battery track for a particular type of gem is full but you will be processing more gems of that type later,
which would refill any mana you use during spell casting.
It is a good idea to have spells from a variety of different phases in your hand. If you have three
different spells from phase V, it will take at least three full turns to cast them all, as you may only case
one spell per phase on any given turn. Having spells from a variety of different phases in your hand
enables you to cast multiple spells during different phases of the same turn.
Players can never go below zero mana on the processing track.
FAQs

Q: Does Suspension mean a player cannot place all of their miners?
A: No. The “skipped” assignment for a player affected by Suspension would merely take place at a
later point during the phase.

Q: Can Backlash be cast on a mine where all three work sites are already full?
A: No. You may only cast Backlash on a mine if there is an available work site for each group of
miners to be pushed back to.
Q: Do spells that target work sites (Gateways, Barrier, etc) affect the topaz bonus miners?
A: No. The topaz bonus miners are unaffected by any spells involving work sites.
Q: Does Barrier affect miners already place at a work site through another spell such as Ambition?
A: No. Barrier only prevents miners being placed at any work sites from that point forward.
Q: Do miners placed inside a mine by the topaz adept have access to the citrine or emerald bonuses?
A: No. Both the citrine and emerald bonuses specifically affect work sites, not any miners placed inside
the mine itself.
Q: Can gems affected by Transfiguration change phases?
A: Whatever stage the gem was in before Transfiguration must stay the same. If a player switches one
of gem phase II for two of an opponent’s gems from phase III, none of those gems would change
phases, they would just move to the opposing player’s queue.
Q: Does the player with the amethyst adept bonus receive battery advancement for spells discarded due
to hand limitations during Phase III?
A: No. The amethyst adept may only take battery advancement for spells they did not select that turn.
Q: When casting Realignment, can a player advance battery levels on different tracks for each
individual gem processed?
A: No. A player casting Realignment may only advance their battery levels on different tracks for each
type of gem processed. If a player processed two emeralds, four sapphires, and three onyx, then the
player may advance one battery by two levels, one by four levels, and a third by three levels. The
player may also use multiple gems on one track (in the example, they could combine their first two
gems to advance one battery six levels).
Q: If Stasis is cast on a gem type, how does that affect other spells which affect that gem’s battery
(Realignment, Siphon, etc)?
A: Stasis stops a gem from creating battery advancement of any type. Thus, even if Realignment is
used, the gem under Stasis would produce no battery advancement.
Q: If multiple players cast Siphon, which players choose which battery track to steal from when each
player processes?
A: Spells always resolve in turn order. Thus, players earlier in the turn order get to choose which
battery to steal from first.

Q: Does Negation affect battery advancement?
A: No. Negation only affects processing mana. Gems still produce full battery advancement.
Q: What happens when Negation is cast multiple times?
A: Any player affected by multiple Negations would progressively lose the processing mana associated
with each remaining unaffected gem type (from most to least).
